style and docement 

this program implement some algorithm in computer graphic
the first picture draw the polyfon in the canvas;

parameters

vertexlist   store all the vertex line by line for the plotting
clipinfo    the x y coordinate of the clip window
resultmat   the normalize and transform matrix

curmat       the changes of the polygon including translate, slope, rotate shown as matrix

polyid     is the id of the polygon


in this picture, i create edge struct

edge contains 
x the x of min y
ymax the max y
ymin the min y
dx the xmax-xmin
dy 
slope dy/dx
inter;

createedgetable is to create an edge table according to the edge information.
in the begin, edges will be stored according to its lowest y coordinate.

dothedraw   this method is to use edgetable and scan line by line to fill the polygon

vectorsort   this method is to sort the edge in the AET according to the x coordinate of lowest y and its slope;

in the transform procedure the x and y coordinate will be influenced by the view and the clip information

multiply this method is to do the multiply of the matrix. it only used in 3*3 matrix;

in the clippolygon procedure we need to clip polygon in a rectangle 

clippolygon     this method is to return the vertex after cliping

is outside    this method is to dicided vertex is outside

find junction   this method is to find the junction of the cliping edge and the actual edge and return the vertex of the junction.
