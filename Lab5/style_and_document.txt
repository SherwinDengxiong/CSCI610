in this lab the program use GLSL to implement the projection procedure

in viewing.cpp
setupfrustum 
use the gluniform1f(loc,1)  to setup. location name is Projectiontype


setuportho
gluniform1f(loc,2) to set up

clearTransforms
set the rotate to {0,0,0}
set the scale to {1,1,1}
set the translate to {0,0,0}

use glUniform3fv(loc , count, vector) to prefrom each list


setuptransform
also use gluniform3fv(loc ,count ,vector) to preform each list 

clearcamera
set the camera to {0,0,0}
set the look to {0,0,-1}
set the up to {0,1,0}
use glUniform3fv(loc , count, vector) to prefrom each list


setuptransform
set the camera, look, up
use glUniform3fv(loc , count, vector) to prefrom each list
